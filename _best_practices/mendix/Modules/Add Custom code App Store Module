Best practice, custom modifying App Store Modules
In case of custom modifying App Store Modules, the following must be done:

1.	Add an entity in the App Store Module, with the name; “AddedCustomCodeToModule”
2.	In the entity documentation describe exactly what has been changed. 
3.	Then add an entity in a custom module with the name; "HelperDependencyAppStoreModuleChanged”. 
4.	Set the association to the entity in the app store module.

In this case, when following above steps, when an update is executed on the App Store module, 
the developer sees in the error log that custom modifications had been made. 
By updating the App Store Module these custom changes are lost. So, the developer can add those custom changes again based on
the documentation. 
By using above steps unforeseen bugs/production problems can be avoided.
